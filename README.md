## üìñ Introduction

Sketchify aims to classify hand-drawn sketches using various machine learning models. By leveraging the Google Quick Draw dataset, we can train our models to recognize different objects based on user-drawn sketches. This project is a great way to explore machine learning techniques and feature engineering.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multiple Classifiers**: Implementations of various classifiers, including:
  - Gaussian Naive Bayes
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Logistic Regression

4. **Download the Dataset**:

   You can find the Google Quick Draw dataset [here](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data). Download the relevant files and place them in the `data` directory.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

After setting up the project, you can start using the classifiers. Here‚Äôs how:

1. **Run the Classifier**:

   You can run any of the implemented classifiers by executing the corresponding Python script. For example, to run the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier, use:

   ```bash
   python gaussian_naive_bayes.py
   ```

2. **Visualize Results**:

   After running the classifiers, you can visualize the results using the provided plotting scripts:

   ```bash
   python visualize_results.py
   ```

## üîç Models Implemented

### 1. Gaussian Naive Bayes

This model assumes that features follow a Gaussian distribution. It is simple yet effective for many classification tasks.

### 2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

KNN classifies data points based on the distance to their nearest neighbors. It is intuitive and works well with smaller datasets.

### 3. Support Vector Machines (SVM)

SVM finds the optimal hyperplane that separates classes. It is effective in high-dimensional spaces.

### 4. Logistic Regression

This model is used for binary classification problems. It estimates the probability that a given input point belongs to a certain class.

### 5. XGBoost

XGBoost is an efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting. It often outperforms other algorithms in competitions.

### 6. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

RNNs are suitable for sequential data. They can capture temporal dependencies in the drawing sequences.

## üìä Data Visualization

Visualizing data is crucial for understanding model performance. Sketchify includes several visualization scripts:

- **Plotting Confusion Matrices**: Understand where your model is making mistakes.
- **Feature Importance**: Identify which features contribute most to model predictions.
- **PCA Visualization**: Reduce dimensionality for better insights into data distribution.
